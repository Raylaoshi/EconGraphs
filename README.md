As a AP Econ teacher, letting students understand and comprehend elementary level graphic models is not as easy as it sounds. Thanks to Chris Makler's KineticGraphs JavaScript Engine (KGJS), I have been able to adapt some of the key economic models for my students and for all students/teachers. This is an ongoning project. As a philosophy-major-turned-econ teacher creating interactive graphic models, various AI tools are my best companion including claude sonnet. If you are interested in this project please drop me a msg. I would be more than happy to chat about it. :)
